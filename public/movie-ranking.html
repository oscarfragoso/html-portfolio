<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Star Wars Episode V: The Impire strikes back</h3>
<p>I love the Star Wars saga, but the episode V is the best there is!</p>

<h3>The lord of the rings: The two towers</h3>
<p>Definitly "The lord of the rings" is one of the best trilogies out there.<br/>What I love the most of this one is the battle at Helm's Deep... I considered one of the top battle scenes in movies</p>

<h3>Batman: The dark knight</h3>
<p>Batman is one of the best superheroes out there, and the Nolan's trilogy is, in my opinion, the best grounded adaptations of batsie.</p>
